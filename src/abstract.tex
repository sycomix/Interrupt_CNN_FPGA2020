Multi-robot exploration (MR-Explore) that provides the location and maps is the basic task for many multi-robot applications. 
The accuracy of some critical components, such as Feature-point Extraction (FE) and Place Recognition (PR), can significantly benefit from convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
To deploy the CNNs on the embedded real-time system, previous works design CNN accelerators on FPGA. 
However, previous CNN accelerators mainly focus on improving the performance of a single neural network, lacking multi-task support.
Since researchers in robotics usually run different CNN tasks simultaneously, the inability of accelerators to support multi-task makes it difficult for researchers in robotics to use embedded FPGA.

We propose an INterruptible CNN Accelerator for Multi-robot Exploration (INCAME) for rapid deployment of MR-Explore on FPGA.
INCAME proposes a virtual-instruction-based interrupt method to support multi-task on CNN accelerators.
After accelerating  CNN backbones, the post-processing of  CNN-based components (such as PR and FE), which is also computation consuming, becomes the bottleneck of the system.
Thus, INCAME also includes RTL/HLS hardware modules to accelerate the post-processing of the CNN-based components.
We evaluate INCAME on Xilinx ZU9 MPSoC. The experiment results show that INCAME enables multi-task scheduling on the CNN accelerator with negligible performance reduction (??\%). With the help of multi-task, INCAME enables embedded FPGA (Xilinx ZU9) executing MA-Explore in real-time (30 fps).
