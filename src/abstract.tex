Multi-robot exploration (MR-Explore) that provides the location and maps is the basic task for many multi-robot applications. 
Feature-point Extraction (FE) and Place Recognition (PR) are two critical modules in MR-Explore.
The accuracy of both modules can benefit from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Previous CNN accelerators on FPGA mainly focus on improving the performance of a single neural network, lacking multi-task support.
Researchers in robotics usually run several CNN tasks simultaneously, such as FE and PR.
The inability of CNN accelerators to support multi-task makes it difficult for researchers in robotics to use embedded FPGA.

We propose a \textit{MU}lti-\textit{RO}bot \textit{EX}ploration \textit{E}ngine (MUROEXE) to deploy MR-Explore on embedded FPGA. 
We propose a virtual-instruction-based interrupt method to support multi-task on CNN accelerators.
Besides the CNN backbone, the post-precessing for CNN-based FE and PR is also computation consuming. 
MUROEXE introduces RTL/HLS modules to accelerate the post-precessing of CNN-based modules.
Experiments show that MUROEXE supports multi-thread scheduling with negligible performance reduction (??\%).
MUROEXE enables embedded FPGA (Xilinx ZU9) executing MA-Explore in real-time (30 fps).
